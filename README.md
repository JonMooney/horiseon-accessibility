# Horiseon Accessibility and Refactor Project

## Description
Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc, a ficticious company, was in need of a developer to update their site to the latest HTML5 standards and to address accessibility concerns. The following items represent the work completed during this project:
<ul>
	<li>Semantic HTML and logical element structuring</li>
	<li>Consolidation and clean up of CSS</li>
	<li>Addition of quality commenting for readability</li>
	<li>Use of alt tags for images</li>
    <li>More descriptive title</li>
    <li>Minor updates to broken links</li>
</ul>

This project was an oppurtunity to put into practice some of the latest HTML5 standards and to learn more about accessibility standards and how web pages should be structured for those with disabilities. 

## Usage
Visit the live site at the following URL:
https://jonmooney.github.io/horiseon-accessibility/

<ul>
    <li>Right click on the web page and select 'View Page Source'</li>
    <li>Look for thoughtful commenting for different sections</li>
    <li>Look for Semantic HTML elements such as the following:
        <ul>
            <li><header></li>
            <li><footer></li>
            <li><section></li>
            <li><main></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>View the alt tags on the 3 images in the main section. This is what will show up when the image link is broken or people using a screen reader, etc.</li>
</ul>


Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
## Credits
List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.
If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.
If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.
## License
The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.
## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
## Features
If your project has a lot of features, list them here.
## How to Contribute
If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
## Tests
Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
